      <p>Coronavirus (COVID-19), the new name for the disease being caused by the recent coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is all over the news. A lot of information is being presented about how help prevent Coronavirus (COVID-19) from affecting you and your family. Perhaps the most important thing to know is that medical experts agree on this: One of the best ways to stay healthy is to wash your hands with soap and water. But if those aren’t available, hand sanitizer may help rid your hands of unwanted germs.</p>
    </div>
        
         <p>Handwashing remains the No. 1 tip for preventing the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19). 
        It’s common sense and it works.<br><br>
        Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands with soap (or equivalent materials) and water to remove viruses/bacteria/microorganisms, dirt, grease, or other harmful and unwanted substances stuck to the hands. Drying of the washed hands is part of the process as wet and moist hands are more easily recontaminated.
        <br><br>Hand washing with soap often, and throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and cholera which are transmitted through fecal–oral route. People can also become more easily infected with respiratory diseases such as the common cold, influenza, SARS, MERS and COVID-19 if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth.

        <br><br>Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures. Hand washing before administering medicine or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease. The main medical purpose of washing hands is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms) and chemicals which can cause harm. This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also an important practice for the general public.
        </p>
        <h4>The World Health Organisation recommends washing hands for at least 20 seconds before/after the following:</h4>
        <p>
        <!--<ul>
            <li><b>Wet</b>: Put both your hands under clean, running water.</li><br>
            <li><b>Lather</b>: Apply a generous amount of soap to the inside and back of your hands as 
                                well as your fingertips. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds (sing happy birthday) 
                                . Your fingertips are especially 
                                important as people often put their fingers on their face, nose, and eyes. 
                                This is how the virus spreads.</li><br>
            <li><b>Scrub</b>: Rub both hands together and move your fingertips around both hands. You don’t need a scrub brush. You don’t need to make harsh, scrubbing movements.</li><br>
            <li><b>Rinse</b>: Return both hands to the running water and gently wash away the soap.</li><br>
            <li><b>Dry</b>: Completely dry the water from your hands. Using a disposable towel (paper towel) is best to avoid leaving germs on towels. Air dryers, commonly found in public bathrooms, are also effective.</li><br>
        </ul>
        --> 
        <ul>
            <li>Before and after caring for any sick person</li>
            <li>Before, during, and after preparing food</li>
            <li>Before eating</li>
            <li>After using the toilet (for urination, defecation, menstrual hygiene)</li>
            <li>After helping someone who just used the toilet</li>
            <li>After blowing one's nose, or coughing or sneezing</li>
            <li>After touching an animal, animal feed or animal waste</li>
            <li>After touching garbage</li>
            <li>After coming from hospital</li>
            <li>After the work</li>
            <li>After any travel</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Effectiveness of Handwashing in Healthcare</h4>
           To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash the hands or use a hand antiseptic before and after tending to a sick person.<br><br>
            For control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand-cleansing came from the first 20% of washing, and that very little additional benefit was gained when hand cleansing frequency was increased beyond 35%.Washing with plain soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial infectious disease transmitted to food as compared to washing with antibacterial soap.<br><br>
            Comparing hand-rubbing with alcohol-based solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap.But soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs for reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from hands<br><br>
            Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings can involve education for staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rub, and written and verbal reminders to staff.There is a need for more research into which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.<br><br>
