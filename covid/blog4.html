          <h4>What is Social Distancing ?</h4>
        <p>Social distancing, also called “physical distancing,” means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your household.
        <br><br>To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces.
        <br><br>Social distancing should be practiced in combination with other everyday preventive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including wearing masks, avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands, and frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
        </p>
        <h4>Why Social Distancing ?</h4>
        <p>COVID-19 can live for hours or days on a surface, depending on factors such as sunlight, humidity, and the type of surface. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Social distancing helps limit opportunities to come in contact with contaminated surfaces and infected people outside the home.</p>
        <p>Although the risk of severe illness may be different for everyone, anyone can get and spread COVID-19. Everyone has a role to play in slowing the spread and protecting themselves, their family, and their community. In addition to practicing everyday steps to prevent COVID-19, keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus and slowing its spread in communities.</p>
        <h4>Some tips for Social Distancing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Know before you go</li><br>
            <li>Prepare for Transportation</li><br>
            <li>Limit Contact when outside</li><br>
            <li>Choose safe social activities</li><br>
            <li>Keep distance at event gatherings</li><br>
            <li>Stay distanced while being active</li><br>
        </ul>
        <h4>Limiting close face-to-face contact with others is the best way to reduce the spread of the Coronavirus disease(COVID-19)</h4>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Now we all know why social distancing is so vital in the fight against coronavirus. And we all have to do our part to win this battle. Stay home, resist the temptation of going out. Use social media and smartphones to stay in touch with friends and family. The crisis will pass only if everyone cooperates. </p>
